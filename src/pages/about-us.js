                            Jonathan Peters, fuelled by an unquenchable ardor for music and artistic expression, emerged in New York Cityâ€™s vibrant dance club and nightlife milieu. He found himself captivated by the transformative power of music, inspiring others and being inspired in turn. Enchanted by the emotional odyssey a DJ could orchestrate through sound, Peters committed to mastering the art of DJing himself.

                            Swiftly cementing a reputable identity, Peters held an array of residencies across the city, at renowned venues including Save the Robots, Nell's, Mirage, Tattoo, and Cafe Society. After over a decade and a half of demonstrating his talents in NYC, he was invited to become the resident DJ at the Soundfactory, taking the reins from esteemed predecessors Frankie Knuckles and Jr Vasquez. For seven years, he presided over Saturday night sessions, drawing crowds of up to 3,000 weekly and 7,000 for special events. Following the closure of Soundfactory, Peters continued his trajectory with further residencies at Spirit NYC and Pacha NYC, solidifying his status as a cornerstone of New York City nightlife. His talents didn't go unnoticed; in 2006, DJ Times Magazine named him the #1 DJ in America.

After the triple platinum remix success of Whitney Houston's "My Love Is Your Love," he cemented his status as one of the industry's most in-demand remixers. Peters has lent his unique touch to a multitude of high-profile artists, such as Whitney Houston, Bob Marley, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, Janet Jackson, Mary J Blige, Deborah Cox, DMX, Garth Brooks, Brain McKnight, Kelly Price, Rihanna, George Micheal, Montell Jorden, Christina Aguilera, Ricky Martin, and many more, producing club mixes resonating globally.
